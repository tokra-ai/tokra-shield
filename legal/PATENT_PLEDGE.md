# Tokra Patent Pledge

Tokra commits that it will not assert claims of any Tokra patents that are necessarily infringed by an open-source implementation of the Tokra Shield SDK/REST API against open-source users, contributors, or distributors, provided the implementation is under an OSI-approved license and used, distributed, or hosted for end users.

This pledge is worldwide, irrevocable, royalty-free, and subject to defensive suspension: if you or your affiliates initiate or join a patent assertion against Tokra or its users regarding Tokra Shield or substantially similar technology, this pledge is suspended for you and your affiliates.

This pledge does not cover trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, patents not owned by Tokra, material deviations from the reference OSS implementation, or combinations outside Tokra Shield. Nothing here is legal advice.
