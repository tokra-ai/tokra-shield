# Tokra Shield Open-Use Patent Pledge

Tokra will not assert Tokra-owned patents **essential to using this repository as
distributed** under the Apache-2.0 license against users who, in good faith,
use, run, modify, and distribute this code in compliance with Apache-2.0.

This pledge is:
- **Additional assurance** to the community (it does not limit the Apache-2.0 rights).
- **Suspended** for any entity that initiates patent litigation against Tokra or
  Tokra Shield users over software/patent claims.
- **Not** a license to proprietary or undisclosed Tokra features not present in this repo.

Purpose: maximize developer freedom while keeping defensive posture against bad-faith litigation.
